Using the COUNTIFS() formula, count how many successful, failed, and canceled projects were created with goals within the ranges listed. Populate the Number Successful, Number Failed, and Number Canceled columns with these data points.

Add up each of the values in the Number Successful, Number Failed, and Number Canceled columns to populate the Total Projects column. Then, using a mathematical formula, find the percentage of projects that were successful, failed, or canceled per goal range.
